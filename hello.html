<h1>Hello Wolrd!
   #h is basically indicate the headline of your page, 
   the greater the number after h the smaller the headline
</h1>
<h2>this is my first html page </h2> 
<p>  1-The p element is the preferred element for paragraph
     text on websites. p is short for "paragraph".
     2-You can add images to your website by using the img element, 
     and point to a specific image's URL using the src attribute.
     Note that img elements are self-closing.
     All img elements must have an alt attribute. The text inside an alt 
     attribute is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load.
     Note: If the image is purely decorative, using an empty alt attribute is a best practice.
     Ideally the alt attribute should not contain special characters unless needed.
    </p>
