<p>
    create a style block; Note that it's important
    to have both opening and closing curly braces
    ({ and }) around each element's style rule(s).
    You also need to make sure that your element's
    style definition is between the opening and 
    closing style tags. Finally, be sure to add 
    a semicolon to the end of each of your element's
    style rules.
