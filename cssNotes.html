    <h1 class="red-text">
        CSS Styling
    </h1>
<p>
    create a style block; Note that it's important
    to have both opening and closing curly braces
    ({ and }) around each element's style rule(s).
    You also need to make sure that your element's
    style definition is between the opening and 
    closing style tags. Finally, be sure to add 
    a semicolon to the end of each of your element's
    style rules.
</p>
<h2 class="blue-text">
    CSS Styling
</h2>
<p>
    You can apply a class to an HTML element like 
    this: h2 class="blue-text" CSS Styling /h2.
     Note that in your CSS style element, 
     class names start with a period. In your HTML
      elements' class attribute,
     the class name does not include the period.
