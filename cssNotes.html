    <h1 class="red-text">CSS Styling</h1>
    <p>
      create a style block; Note that it's important to have both opening and
      closing curly braces ({ and }) around each element's style rule(s). You
      also need to make sure that your element's style definition is between the
      opening and closing style tags. Finally, be sure to add a semicolon to the
      end of each of your element's style rules.
    </p>
    <h> CSS Styling </h>
    <p>
      You can apply a class to an HTML element like this: h2 class="blue-text"
      CSS Styling /h2. Note that in your CSS style element, class names start
      with a period. In your HTML elements' class attribute, the class name does
      not include the period.

    <p class="blue-text">
      To import a Google Font, you can copy the font's URL from the Google Fonts
      library and then paste it in your HTML. For this challenge, we'll import
      the Lobster font. To do this, copy the following code snippet and paste it
      into the top of your code editor (before the opening style element you
      need to mention the type at the end of link

    <h id="element-id"> Set the id of an Element </h>
    <p class="subtle-Pattern">
      HTML element can also have an id attribute. There are several benefits to
      using id attributes: You can use an id to style a single element and later
      you'll learn that you can use them to select and modify specific elements
      with JavaScript. id attributes should be unique

    <h> Adjust the Padding of an Element </h>
    <p class="subtle-Pattern">
      specifying an element's padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, and
      padding-left like this (padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;) Three important
      properties control the space that surrounds each HTML element: padding,
      border, and margin padding controls the amount of space between the
      element's content and its borde
    </p>
    <h> Adjust the Margin of an Element </h>
    <p class="subtle-Pattern">
      When you increase the blue box's margin, it will increase the distance
      between its border and surrounding elements.
    </p>

    <h class="red-box"> Use Hex Code for Specific Colors </h>
    <p class="subtle-Pattern">
      the symbols 0-9 represent the values zero to nine. Then A,B,C,D,E,F
      represent the values ten to fifteen. Altogethe In CSS, we can use 6
      hexadecimal digits to represent colors, two each for the red (R), green
      (G), and blue (B) components. For example, #000000 is black and is also
      the lowest possible value. The digit F is the highest number in hex code,
      and represents the maximum possible brightness.
    </p>

    <h class="red-box"> position of an element </h>
    <p1 class="p1">
      When the position of an element is set to relative, it allows you to
      specify how CSS should move it relative to its current position in the
      normal flow of the page. It pairs with the CSS offset properties of left
      or right, and top or bottom. These say how many pixels, percentages, or
      ems to move the item away from where it is normally positioned. The
      following example moves the paragraph 10 pixels away from the bottom: The
      next option for the CSS position property is absolute, which locks the
      element in place relative to its parent container. Unlike the relative
      position, this removes the element from the normal flow of the document,
      so surrounding items ignore it. The CSS offset properties (top or bottom
      and left or right) are used to adjust the position. One nuance with
      absolute positioning is that it will be locked relative to its closest
      positioned ancestor. If you forget to add a position rule to the parent
      item, (this is typically done using position: relative;), the browser will
      keep looking up the chain and ultimately default to the body tag. The next
      layout scheme that CSS offers is the fixed position, which is a type of
      absolute positioning that locks an element relative to the browser window.
      Similar to absolute positioning, it's used with the CSS offset properties
      and also removes the element from the normal flow of the document. Other
      items no longer "realize" where it is positioned, which may require some
      layout adjustments elsewhere. One key difference between the fixed and
      absolute positions is that an element with a fixed position won't move
      when the user scrolls.
    </p1>

    <h class="red-box"> float Propert & Overlapping </h>
    <p class="subtle-Pattern">
      The next positioning tool does not actually use position, but sets the
      float property of an element. Floating elements are removed from the
      normal flow of a document and pushed to either the left or right of their
      containing parent element. It's commonly used with the width property to
      specify how much horizontal space the floated element requires. means you
      need to have width property to enable it in this way; float: right; width:
      40%; When elements are positioned to overlap (i.e. using position:
      absolute | relative | fixed | sticky), the element coming later in the
      HTML markup will, by default, appear on the top of the other elements.
      However, the z-index property can specify the order of how elements are
      stacked on top of one another. It must be an integer (i.e. a whole number
      and not a decimal), and higher values for the z-index property of an
      element move it higher in the stack than those with lower values.

    <h class="red-box"> General Notes </h>
    <p class="subtle-Pattern">
<ol>
<li>
    An ID selector begins with a # rather than a dot character
    , but is used in the same way as a class selector. 
    However, an ID can be used only once per page, 
    and elements can only have a single id value applied to
     them.

<li>
    <a href=""> this is used to show wahts in the link</a>
    href is called attribute and you can use getAtrribute to change it
</li>
<li>
    When you change a link URL with JavaScript, youll have to use the setAttribute method:
    element.setAttribute('href','http://www.ronvangorp.com');
    this will change the selected link to whats after setAttribute
